              Death of a family member is not only a great loss
              but also a devastating experience.
              There are tons of questions and tax implications (like funeral
              expenses, medical expenses, insurance benefits, RRSP, House, Business and more).

            <div class="body-2 text-xs-center pr-3 pl-3 pt-3 pb-5  ">
              U.S. Income Tax is based on Citizenship whereas
              Canadian Income Tax is based on Residency.
              It means that if you are U.S. Citizen and Resident in Canada
              you have to file returns in both the U.S. and Canada.
              This does not mean that you have to pay double tax.
              There are treaties between U.S. and Canada under which certain
              deductions and credits can be claimed to
              prevent double taxation. U.S. Citizens living abroad have an
              automatic extension of two months to file
              U.S. Tax Returns (This means that the regular due date of
              April 15 is extended to June 15 of each year)
